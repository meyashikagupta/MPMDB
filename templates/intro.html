      The Medicinal Plant Metabolite Database unifies botanical descriptors, secondary metabolite catalogs,
      and omics-ready references so researchers can move from ethnobotanical observation to validated leads.

    <h2>Why medicinal plants matter</h2>
    <p>
      Medicinal plants are defined by the WHO as any plant whose organs contain bioactive substances for
      therapeutic use or as chemo-pharmaceutical precursors. More than 250,000 flowering species are recognised
      for their secondary metabolitesâ€”alkaloids, flavonoids, glycosides, terpenoidsâ€”that underpin modern and
      traditional pharmacopeias alike.
    </p>
    <p>
      Historical records from every civilisation document herbal remedies managing human and animal health.
      Today the pharmaceutical, cosmetic, agricultural, and food industries adapt these botanicals,
      coupling ethnopharmacology with reproducible analytical methods.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bangladesh alone catalogues 500+ medicinal species, supporting 400 Ayurvedic, Unani, and homoeopathic
      production facilities. Similar growth trajectories exist across India, where agro-climatic diversity enables
      wide cultivation and export of high-value crops such as opium poppy, senna, psyllium, and cinchona.

    <h2>Characteristics of medicinal plants</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Synergic medicine:</strong> multiple phytochemicals act concurrently, amplifying benefits or mitigating
        adverse effects when prepared responsibly.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Adjunct potential:</strong> plant-derived compounds complement frontline therapies, including
        oncology and chronic inflammatory indications.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Preventive posture:</strong> bioactives often delay disease onset, reducing reliance on synthetic
        interventions once pathology is established.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Importance and scope</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Indiaâ€™s agro-climatic range supports nearly every globally known medicinal species.</li>
      <li>Indigenous Systems of Medicine (Ayurveda, Siddha, Unani) rely on plant-based materia medica.</li>
      <li>
        First-line care for jaundice, asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes, and more is often rooted in botanicals.
      </li>
      <li>Exports of raw botanicals and derived medicines exceed â‚¹860 million annually.</li>
      <li>Priorities include knowledge protection, quality certification, and habitat conservation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Applied opportunities</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Seeds & agronomy:</strong> high-yield cultivars and GAP-compliant farming enable reliable supply chains.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Plant parts:</strong> leaves, bark, roots, and seeds power crude drug markets and value-added processing.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Plant drugs & nutraceuticals:</strong> Ayurvedic, Siddha, and homoeopathic formulations expand into
        global wellness segments.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Herbal biocontrol & edibles:</strong> botanical pesticides, functional foods, and beverages form rapidly
        growing cottage industries.

    <h2>Benefits and gains</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Accessible economics:</strong> botanical therapies provide lower-cost alternatives as prescription prices rise.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Favourable safety:</strong> many herbs demonstrate gentler side-effect profiles compared to synthetic analogues.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Polyvalent action:</strong> a single plant can modulate multiple physiological pathways simultaneously.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Market momentum:</strong> complementary medicine adoption accelerates worldwide, backed by growing clinical evidence.
